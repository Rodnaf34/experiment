    <h1>Fleshing out the concept</h1>
    <h2>What is Identigo</h2>
    <p>Identigo is both a token on the solana blockchain and it's idea. It's an idea that seeks to connect the world of Web 3.0 with
      real world use-cases that are within reach of [semi] regular people.
    </p>
    <h2>Starting from scratch</h2>
    <p>This is my starting wireframe. This site is intended to be a place where I test ideas as I figure out the best way to present this work to the user.
      I am genuinly starting from scratch with this. I need to do everything from the concept development to the code for the front end, 
      developing the logic for the functionality of the platform, all the way to the business model and operating model.
      There seems to be at least a year of work for team of professionals and I have to figure out how I do all of it myself.
      Seems crazy.
